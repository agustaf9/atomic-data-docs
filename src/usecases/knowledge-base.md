# Atomic Server as a Knowledge Base

A Knowledge Base is a tool that helps you to store and manage data.
They are designed to be very flexible, and can be used for many purposes.
In a way they are the antidote to using many different online tools for very different purposes.

Knowledge bases can be used to:

- Document features of a product or service
- Meeting minutes
- Plan projects
- Manage team members and their profiles
- Describe strategy
- Document features
- Document bugs

Some organisations store this information in a shared folder in Google Drive,
some have a bunch of spreadsheets,
and some may have

## Why Atomic Data is a great standard for storing knowledge

Atomic Data is structured in a way that makes re-use very easy.
Every property of data has its own URL, which helps users to know what a piece of data semantically represents.
All data models can be instantly re-used in other applications, and you can re-use data models from others, too.

For developers, Atomic Data is great as it has a very simple yet powerful RESTful API.
Because it's entirely open and free, there's no vendor lock-in.

## Why Atomic Server is a great knowledge base

Atomic Data is a _specification_ that is suitable for knowledge bases, and Atomic Server is a _piece of software_.
[Atomic Server](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-data-rust) is an open source knowledge base that is very powerful, feature-rich, and easy to use.

- **Real-time collaboration on everything**. Every piece of data updates in real time.
- **Full history control**. Every action is stored, can be reverted and can be traced back to individuals.
- **Rich documents**. Create documents in and easy to use, powerful editor
- **Tables**.
- **Search**. Powerful full-text search.
- **Rights management**. Set permissions for users and groups.
- **Great performance**. Atomic Server is written in Rust, and can be thought of as its own database. It's really fast, even on slower hardware.
- **Open source**. Atomic Server is open source, and can be used by anyone.
- **Easy to host by yourself**. Just one binary of less than 8MB is needed, without any runtime dependencies.
